# CE detector configurations


## Conventions

1. The same as used in Bilby [1, 2], which is different from what is used in [3, 4].
1. Latitides are positive in the northern hemisphere
1. Longitudes are positive to the east of the Greenwich meridian.
1. Orientation is defined as the angle north of the east of the x-arm.
1. For L-shaped detectors, x-arm completes a right handed coordinate system together with the local outward vertical normal and y-arm.
